# 🧠 Memory Match Game (Java + OOP + AWS Integration)

This project is a simple Memory Card Matching Game built using Java Swing and  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  principles.
It is part of our group project where each team member created different small games such as Tic Tac Toe and Whack a Mole.
